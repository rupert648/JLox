# JLox
Java Interpreter for the lox programming language.
### The Lox Programming Language
For more information on the Lox programming language, please refer to the [Crafting Interpreters Book](https://craftinginterpreters.com)
### This Project
This project is a Java based implementation for an interpreter of the Lox programming language.
Much of this work is derived from reading and workign through the [Crafting Interpreters Book](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom.

I have later plans to re-implement this project in **Rust**, although I thought it would be best to get the basics down first before moving on to more complex implementations.
